To run the code, to crack the cipher text, two files are necessary.
- enchiphered_text.py where the enchiphered text is added
- autokey_crack.py which is the main file to be run to run 
  the decryption process after the encrypted text is added 
  to the enchiphered_text.py

RUN COMMAND: python3 autokey_crack.py
