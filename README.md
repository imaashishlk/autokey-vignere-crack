The program implements in cracking an Vignere Autokey Ciphered text without the key. It uses the bruteforce method in finding the key utilizing the word frequencies in the English Language. 

The source code is divided with multiple files.

To run the code, to crack the cipher text, two files are necessary.
- enchiphered_text.py where the enchiphered text is to be added
- autokey_crack.py which is the main file to be run to run 
  the decryption process after the encrypted text is added 
  to the enchiphered_text.py

RUN COMMAND: python3 autokey_crack.py
